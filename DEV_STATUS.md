# üöß Development Status

**Current Version:** v0.2.0-alpha  
**Status:** Active Development  
**Last Updated:** October 23, 2025

- ‚úì **TAFM (Turbidity-Adaptive Fusion Module)** - Novel turbidity adaptation working
- ‚úì **Model Architecture** - Forward pass tested and verified

### Data Pipeline

- ‚úì **Data Loader** - COCO format parsing working
- ‚úì **Augmentations** - Underwater-specific transformations implemented
- ‚úì **3-Class Configuration** - Trash, Animal, ROV classes configured

### Training Infrastructure
- ‚úì **Training Script** - End-to-end training pipeline working
- ‚úì **Loss Functions** - EIoU, Varifocal, BCE losses implemented
- ‚úì **Optimizer** - AdamW with cosine annealing scheduler
- ‚úì **Checkpointing** - Model saving and loading working
- ‚úì **Logging** - Training metrics tracked and logged

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

### 1. Loss Function (Placeholder Implementation)
**Status:** Currently using simplified dummy loss calculations

**Current Behavior:**
- Bbox loss: Fixed value (1.0)
- Obj loss: Random targets for demonstration
- Cls loss: Fixed value (0.5)
- **Result:** Metrics show 0.0000 (expected behavior)

**What's Needed:**
- Proper target assignment algorithm (matching predictions to ground truth)
- Anchor-based or anchor-free assignment strategy
- IoU-based positive/negative sample selection

**Workaround for Testing:**
- Architecture can be tested with forward passes
- Training pipeline works but doesn't learn
- Can be used for architecture validation

### 2. Evaluation Metrics
**Status:** Placeholder implementation

**Current Behavior:**
- Returns 0.0 for all metrics (Precision, Recall, mAP)
- No actual prediction-to-ground-truth matching

**What's Needed:**
- Proper NMS (Non-Maximum Suppression)
- IoU calculation between predictions and targets
- COCO evaluation protocol implementation

### 3. Detection Script
**Status:** Basic implementation, needs post-processing

**What's Needed:**
- Confidence threshold filtering
- NMS for overlapping boxes
- Proper output formatting

## üîß For Developers

### Running Architecture Tests
```bash
# Test model forward pass
python -c "
import torch
from models.yolo_udd import build_yolo_udd

model = build_yolo_udd(num_classes=3)
model.eval()
x = torch.randn(1, 3, 640, 640)
with torch.no_grad():
    predictions, turb_score = model(x)
print('‚úì Forward pass successful!')
"
```

### Running Training (Current State)
```bash
# Note: Will run but not learn due to placeholder loss
python scripts/train.py \
    --config configs/train_config.yaml \
    --data-dir data/trashcan \
    --batch-size 4 \
    --epochs 10
```

### What Works Now
- ‚úÖ Model architecture (all modules)
- ‚úÖ Data loading
- ‚úÖ Training loop
- ‚úÖ Checkpointing
- ‚úÖ Turbidity estimation

### What Doesn't Work Yet
- ‚ùå Actual learning (placeholder loss)
- ‚ùå Meaningful metrics
- ‚ùå Detection inference

## üìä Test Results

**Architecture Test** (October 23, 2025):
```
‚úì Forward pass successful!
Turbidity Score: 0.2044
Number of detection scales: 3
  Scale 1 - BBox: torch.Size([1, 4, 80, 80])
  Scale 2 - BBox: torch.Size([1, 4, 40, 40])
  Scale 3 - BBox: torch.Size([1, 4, 20, 20])
```

**Training Test** (5 epochs):
```
Epoch 0/5: Train Loss: 6.2354 | Val Loss: 6.3097
Epoch 4/5: Train Loss: 6.2057 | Val Loss: 6.2406
‚úì Training pipeline works!
```
