### �� Recent Critical Fixes

1. **Validation BCE Error** (Fixed - Jan 2025)
   - Issue: RuntimeError during validation due to NaN values in sigmoid
   - Solution: Pre-sigmoid clamping (-50, 50) + torch.nan_to_num()
   - Result: Training completes successfully without crashes

2. **Target Assignment** (Implemented - Jan 2025)
   - Issue: Placeholder dummy targets preventing learning
   - Solution: Proper grid-based assignment with GT matching
   - Result: Real loss values showing actual learning

3. **Loss Functions** (Upgraded - Jan 2025)
   - Issue: Placeholder loss returning zeros
   - Solution: Real EIoU, BCE objectness, BCE classification
   - Result: bbox_loss, obj_loss, cls_loss all showing meaningful values

### 📊 Training Status

**Last Test Run:**
- Epochs: 2 (test run completed successfully)
- Batch Size: 1
- Loss Values: Decreasing (indicating learning)
- Validation: Completes without errors
- Metrics: Infrastructure ready (returns 0.0 pending full training)

**Ready for Extended Training:**
- All components operational
- Can run 50-300 epoch training
- Metrics will be computed with proper mAP protocol
