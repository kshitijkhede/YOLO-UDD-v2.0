## 📈 Recommended Next Steps

### 1. View Training Curves 📊
```bash
tensorboard --logdir=runs/train/logs/
```
This will show:
- Training/validation loss over epochs
- Learning rate schedule
- Model performance metrics

### 2. Run Model Evaluation 🧪
```bash
python scripts/evaluate.py \
    --config configs/train_config.yaml \
    --checkpoint runs/train/checkpoints/latest.pt \
    --data-dir data/trashcan \
    --save-dir runs/eval/
```

### 3. Test Inference on New Images 🖼️
```bash
python scripts/detect.py \
    --checkpoint runs/train/checkpoints/latest.pt \
    --source <path_to_test_images> \
    --save-dir runs/detect/ \
    --conf-threshold 0.5
```

### 4. Analyze Results 📊
- Check precision, recall, mAP metrics
- Visualize detection outputs
- Compare with baseline models

## 🔍 Quality Check

### Checkpoint File Analysis:
- **File Size:** 695 MB (expected for full YOLO model)
- **Last Modified:** October 23, 2025, 14:17
- **Location:** `runs/train/checkpoints/latest.pt`

### Expected Contents:
The checkpoint should contain:
- ✅ Model weights (state_dict)
- ✅ Optimizer state
- ✅ Training epoch number
- ✅ Loss values
- ✅ Hyperparameters

To verify checkpoint contents (requires PyTorch):
```python
import torch
ckpt = torch.load('runs/train/checkpoints/latest.pt')
print(ckpt.keys())
```
