## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations (Documented)

### Loss Function Implementation
**Current State:** Uses simplified placeholder calculations

**What's There:**
- EIoU Loss structure (implemented)
- Varifocal Loss structure (implemented)

**What's Missing:**
- Proper target assignment algorithm
- Anchor matching or anchor-free assignment
- Real IoU calculation between predictions and ground truth

**Impact:** 
- Training pipeline runs successfully
- Loss values update each epoch
- Metrics show 0.0 (expected with placeholder targets)
- Model doesn't actually learn yet

**Documented:** Yes, clearly stated in README and DEV_STATUS.md

### Evaluation Metrics
**Current State:** Placeholder implementation returning 0.0

**What's Needed:**
- NMS (Non-Maximum Suppression)
- IoU-based matching
- COCO evaluation protocol

**Documented:** Yes, in DEV_STATUS.md
